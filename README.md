# Heyday-script
**Background of Auburn Univeristy's Hey Day Tradition:**
Auburn University's Hey Day is a beloved tradition that encourages students, faculty, and staff to greet each other with a friendly "Hey!" or "Hello!" using name tags displaying their first names and academic affiliations. This simple gesture fosters a sense of community, inclusiveness, and friendship on campus, making Hey Day a cherished annual event that unites the Auburn University family.
## Capturing the User's Name
In order to get the user to enter their name for use later in the script the code echos the following: 'Please enter your name:'. Then once the user has provided that information the code stores that name as a variable to be used in the greeting statement: 'Hey! $name, it is nice to meet you!'.
